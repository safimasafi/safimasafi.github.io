30 Minute Film Festival

S(TILL) LOADING…

‘S(till) Loading…’ was a short 2-minute film that I made and turned to black and white to match the overall theme of the page, and site in general. Something about the ambiguous nature, and not having a clear narrative of the video made me want to create the website in a similar theme. 
I kept the content of the page very limited: a video, photo and text (mostly); straight to the point. I also made the page after creating my home page, which only features a GIF and text. Following that, I had to make sure not to over add any content which will draw away from the minimalist design I wanted to go for.
Initially wanting to have a series of modified images of the glitched GIF from the homepage unique to each portfolio page, I decided to go against that for the 30MFF as I saw a trafficking of media. Rather, I put the video as the first thing the visitor sees, big and centre. 

Unfortunately, the 30mff video didn’t seem to show up on GitHub Pages after many attempts in trying to load it from an embedded link or from the file. Instead, I decided to upload the video to YouTube and embed the video using <iframe>. While that worked, it removed the clean layout I was aiming for, such as not having the video title display, YouTube logo on the frame and playlist display at end of video; that was something I failed to make work. I removed all control function to keep the presentation in slight harmony with the overall experience I wanted to create. 
 As for the interactive/JS element, I used the ‘mouseOver’ event near the end of the page, after briefly describing the video, to change the colour of the linked text ‘Inspiration’. At first, I wanted to have a 'div' element where the ‘inspiration’ text would be in a coloured box so the user can see it clearer and once hovering over it, it would change text to a link but after many failed attempts only to realise that I misspelt the 'script' which linked to the JS, I settled for just a change in text colour.  
I also didn’t want to add any big interactive elements as I felt the layout of the page was enough as is, and adding anything more to it would change the overall feel, hence the simple ‘Inspiration” link, which opens to a new page of a work that inspired me to do the 30mff.
Finally, while I wanted to have all the page layouts follow a horizontal layout, it felt natural to have the 30mff set to a vertical layout so that there will be more ‘open’ space.
